I am an assistant professor with the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/) at Johns Hopkins University, the [Mathematical Institute for Data Science (MINDS)](https://www.minds.jhu.edu/), and the [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Institute (DSAI)](https://engineering.jhu.edu/Datascience-AI/). Before that, I was a METEOR and FODSI postdoctoral fellow working with Prof. Stefanie Jegelka at MIT, and a Google Research Fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. I obtained my PhD from the Electrical and Systems Engineering Department at Penn, where I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Alejandro Ribeiro. 

My research is at the intersection of machine learning, signal processing, and network science, with a focus on developing scalable algorithms for learning on non-Euclidean domains such as graphs and data manifolds. I work on **large-scale graph information processing**, **graph neural networks (GNNs)**, and the **theoretical limits of transferability and generalization in graph-based learning**. I am also interested in **physics-informed machine learning**, **manifold learning**, and **combinatorial optimization**, especially as they relate to the structure and dynamics of complex systems.

You can find my **CV** [here](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/lrubini1_jh_edu/ER2fOc9N0x1MtyNm1a4O_xQB1LwzWw6SgbXeWIwR6X3PjQ?e=O8vQbd), and a **selected list of publications** is included below.

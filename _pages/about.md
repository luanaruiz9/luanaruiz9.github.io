I am an Assistant Professor with the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University. Before that, I was a METEOR and FODSI postdoctoral fellow working with Prof. Stefanie Jegelka at MIT, and a Google Research Fellow at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing. I obtained my PhD from the Electrical and Systems Engineering Department at Penn, where I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Alejandro Ribeiro. 

My primary research interests are in the areas of machine learning and signal processing over networks. My current work focuses on large-scale graph information processing and graph neural network architectures. Please check a selected list of my publications below, and my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k7tnugb9yrfjieq/cv_luana_ruiz.pdf?dl=0)(last updated September 2023). My job application materials can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cu97rg61qvsa8dr/AAAyC45G_0L_lxmlTT0k9XIBa?dl=0).

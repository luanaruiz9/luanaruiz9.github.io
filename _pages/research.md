## Research

My research focuses on machine learning, signal processing, and network science, with an emphasis on learning over graphs and manifolds. I explore the theoretical foundations and practical implementations of scalable algorithms for large, non-Euclidean datasets. My work is organized into the following areas:

### Graphon Signal Processing and Transferability

I investigate signal processing and learning in the graphon regime, where graphs are modeled as samples from limit objects. My work formalizes the transferability of graph neural networks (GNNs) by analyzing their stability under graph perturbations and spectral convergence. This includes early formulations of graphon signal processing and the development of graphon neural networks for learning transferable models across large, random graphs.

### Manifold Signal Processing and Manifold Neural Networks

I study signal processing on data manifolds and its integration with deep learning. This includes defining convolutional filters on Riemannian manifolds, studying their stability, and developing manifold neural networks. Applications range from image classification to physics-informed machine learning, where the geometry of the data plays a critical role.

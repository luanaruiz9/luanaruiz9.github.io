## Spring 2025: EN.553.744 – Data Science Methods for Large-Scale Graphs (new class!)

This graduate course introduces mathematical and computational methods for analyzing graph-structured data at scale. Topics span graph signal processing, graph neural networks (GNNs), graphon theory and transferability, and scalable training techniques for large graphs. Students engage with both foundational theory and practical implementation using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric.

**Lectures**  

Lectures 1–10 cover graph signal processing, graph Fourier transforms, graph filters, multilayer GNNs, spectral clustering, and stochastic block models.
Lectures 11–20 build toward expressivity and stability of GNNs, Lipschitz filter design, graphon models, and convergence and transferability results.
Lecture 21 introduces generative models for graphs, including GraphRNNs, graph VAEs, and transformer-based graph generation.

Below is a list of handwritten lecture notes, Colab notebooks, and lab assignments.
